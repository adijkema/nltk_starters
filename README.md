# NLTK for starters
Some basic use of the Natural Language Processing Toolkit in Python

## Purpose: 
Use the main file to discover some of the basic functions in the NLTK library for python.  
It will give some insight in how to break down a text-string into chunks and tag them.  

For it to work with its functions, NLTK needs some **wordbanks** to download into your environment.  
It will warn you when those wordbanks are missing and how to proceed.

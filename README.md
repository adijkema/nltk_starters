# nltk_starters
Some basic use of the Natural Language Processing Toolkit in Python

## Purpose: 
Use the main file to discover some of the basic functions in the NLTK library for python.  
It will give some insight in how to break down a text-string into chunks and tag them.  

NLTK will need some wordbanks to donload into your environment for it to work with its functions.  
It will warn you when those wordbanks are missing and how to proceed.
